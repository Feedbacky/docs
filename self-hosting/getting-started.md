<details>

<summary>Docker with Compose.</summary>

* The [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are necessary dependencies for Feedbacky.

### Installing Docker

1\. Make sure that your system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Docker requires some dependencies to be installed on your system.

```
 sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

3\. Add Docker's official GPG key.

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

4\. Use Docker's stable repository.

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

5\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y

```

2\. Change the permission of downloaded Docker Compose binaries.

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

3\. Test that Docker Compose was successfully installed.&#x20;

```
docker-compose --version
```

<details>

<summary>An SQL database of your choice.</summary>

* It is recommended to use MariaDB instead of MySQL, though it will also work for Feedbacky if you have it installed already.

### Installing MariaDB

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the MariaDB server package.

```
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server
```

3\. Go through the guid

</details>

<details>

<summary>A webserver of your choice.</summary>

* Any webserver can be used as long as reverse proxy is supported, below are installation guide for both Apache and NGINX use whichever you want.

### Installing Apache

* <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Using a Virtual Private Server (VPS) provider? Make sure that the use of virtualization is available.</mark>&#x20;
  * <mark style="background-color:yellow;">Additionally memory limited VPS should have Swap space available.

* You will need an SMTP server or use one of the following Mail providers;
  * Mailgun
  * SendGrid
* Since Feedbacky is password-less (we use OAuth2), you will need an account on at least one of the following services;
  * [Discord](https://discord.com)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * [Google](https://www.google.com)

## Installation

{% hint style="info" %}
**Want to use the most recent features?**

Consider using our [development branch](../self-hosting-1.0.0/1.0.0-wip-hosting-feedback-instance.md) as it is regularly updated.&#x20;

_Be aware that while many uses this branch in their production servers (in fact_ [_we do!_](https://app.feedbacky.net/b/feedbacky-official)_) using bleeding edge features can lead to some issue._
{% endhint %}

### Cloning the repository

Using `git` clone the official [Feedbacky repository](https://github.com/feedbacky-project/app).

```
git clone https://github.com/feedbacky-project/app
```

### Setting up the database

You need to create an user and a table that will be used for Feedbacky, start the SQL shell.

```
sudo mysql
```

1\. Creating a new user.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Creating a `localhost` user will not work due to the nature of Docker, since it will treat your container as a remote machine.

To mitigate the issue, we will use the `%` wildcard instead.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

```sql
CREATE USER '{MYSQL_USERNAME}'@'%' IDNTIFIED BY '{MYSQL_PASSWORD}';
```

| `{MYSQL_USERNAME}` | The username of your choice. |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `{MYSQL_PASSWORD}` | The password of your choice. |

2\. Creating a new table.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE feedbacky;
```

3\. Grant all privileges.

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON feedbacky.* TO '{MYSQL_USERNAME'@'%';
```

4\. Flush the privileges.

{% hint style="info" %}
Flush will reload the privileges without having the need to restart the MariaDB service.
{% endhint %}

```sql
FLUSH PRIVLEGES;
```

5\. Exiting the SQL shell.

```
exit
```

6\. Additional configuration.

We need to edit the&#x20;



{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that `localhost` won't work in `MYSQL_URL` variable due to nature of Docker (container is considered as a remote machine).

IP of server must be provided and MySQL must be configured to accept non localhost connections.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To allow non localhost connections modify `bind-address` at `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` to `0.0.0.0,`restart mysql service with `service mysql restart` and create MySQL user with `%` login access eg. `'feedbacky'@'%'`.
{% endhint %}



\*\*

Due to the nature of Docker, you won't be able to use localhost&#x20;





### Environment Variables

Each variables already have their own descriptions but we have to go in further details with some.&#x20;

Edit your environment.

```
sudo nano .env
```

#### `REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS`

The location where Feedbacky will be hosted, put your machine's local IP address or domain.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
The port is only required if you don't use a domain.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="danger" %}
**Format**

Make sure you use the correct format for the this variable. For example, let's say our IP address is `188.222.333.22` the format will look like this;

**Correct**

* ‚úÖ http://188.222.333.22:8090

**Invalid**

* ‚ùå http://188.222.333.22:8090<mark style="color:red;">**/**</mark> - _Do not use trailing slash at the end_
* ‚Äã‚ùå <mark style="color:red;">**http://**</mark>188.222.333.22:8090 - _`http://` is missing_
* ‚Äã‚ùå http://188.222.333.22<mark style="color:red;">**:8090**</mark> - _The port is missing_
{% endhint %}
