description: Things to keep in mind before installing Feedbacky.
---

# Prerequisites

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Using a Virtual Private Server (VPS)?**

Make sure that virtualization is supported as it is required for Docker. Additionally if you are limited to less than 2GB of memory you should assign some space for [Swap](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-add-swap-space-on-ubuntu-20-04).
{% endhint %}

* An SMTP server is required in order for Feedbacky to send notification if subscribed to an idea, you can also use one of the following Mail providers;
  * Mailgun
  * SendGrid
* Since Feedbacky is password-less (we use OAuth2), you will need an account on at least one of the following services;
  * [Discord](https://discord.com)
  * [GitHub](https://github.com)
  * [Google](https://www.google.com)

## Docker

Both the [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) are necessary dependencies for Feedbacky.

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Make sure that your system is up to date.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Docker requires some dependencies to be installed on your system.

```
 sudo apt install -y ca-certificates curl gnupg lsb-release
```

3\. Add Docker's official GPG key.

```
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg
```

4\. Use Docker's stable repository.

```
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/docker-archive-keyring.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null
```

5\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

6\. Install Docker Engine and it's related packages.

```
sudo apt install -y docker-ce docker-ce-cli containerd.io
```

7\. Test that the Docker Engine was successfully installed.

```
sudo docker run hello-world
```

8\. Download the Docker Compose repository.

```
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.29.2/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

9\. Change the permission of downloaded Docker Compose binaries.

```
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

10\. Test that Docker Compose was successfully installed.&#x20;

```
docker-compose --version
```

## MariaDB

MariaDB is recommended over MySQL as it brings better performance but MySQL will still work with Feedbacky if you already have it installed.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Additional configuration needed, do not skip this part if you already have MariaDB or MySQL installed.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the MariaDB server package.

```
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server
```

3\. Run and go through the security script.

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

The script will ask you to set a root password, press `N` to skip it. The root password is already tied to the system on Ubuntu and changing it could result in MariaDB breaking.

Next we need to do some additional configuration, Docker will treat your container as a remote machine so we need to change the `bind-address` setting in order to accept non localhost connections.

4\. Edit your `50-server.cnf`.

```
sudo nano /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf
```

5\. Change the value of `bind-address` to `0.0.0.0`.

{% code title="50-server.cnf" %}
```
bind-address            = 0.0.0.0
```
{% endcode %}

6\. Save the file with `CTRL` + `S` and exit nano with `CTRL` + `C`.

7\. Restart MariaDB.

```
sudo systemctl restart mariadb-server
```

</details>

## Webserver

A webserver is needed in order to point a domain to your instance. Any will suffice as long as they support reverse proxy.

{% hint style="info" %}
Reverse proxy is supported by NGINX out of the box while Apache will need some extra configuration.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide (Apache)</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the Apache package.

```
sudo apt install -y apache2
```

3\. Verify that Apache is running.

```
sudo systemctl status apache2
```

</details>

<details>

<summary>Installation Guide (NGINX)</summary>

1\. Update your system.

```
sudo apt update -y
```

2\. Install the NGINX package.

```
sudo apt install -y nginx
```

3\. Verify that NGINX is running.

```
sudo systemctl status nginx
```

</details>

{% hint style="success" %}
When done, you can proceed to the main installation guide.
{% endhint %}
