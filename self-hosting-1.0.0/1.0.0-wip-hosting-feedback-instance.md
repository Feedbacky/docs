description: How to run the Feedbacky development branch on your own server.
---

# Getting Started (1.0.0)

{% hint style="danger" %}
This is a work in progress guide and is only related to our development branch, unless you intend on using that branch, please refer to this [guide](../self-hosting/hosting-feedbacky-instance.md) instead.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="warning" %}
This guide was written assuming you are using Ubuntu 20.04 as your main OS or any other Debian-based distribution.

Windows or Mac OS users may need different setup to self-host Feedbacky.
{% endhint %}

## Prerequisites

* Docker [(installation tutorial (just step 1 required))](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-20-04)
* Docker Compose [(installation tutorial)](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* MySQL Database [(installation tutorial)](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mysql-on-ubuntu-20-04)
* SMTP mail server **or** account at [Mailgun](../self-hosting/mailgun.com) **or** account at [SendGrid](../self-hosting/sendgrid.com)
* An account on at least one of the following services, [Discord](https://discord.com), [GitHub](https://github.com), [Google](https://www.google.com) (for OAuth login since Feedbacky is passwordless)
* 200 MB free space for Feedbacky itself

## Installation

1. Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` inside folder where you want to host Feedbacky instance and fill it with these contents:

```
version: '3.3'

services:
  feedbacky-client:
    container_name: feedbacky-client
    environment:
      - REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS=${REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS}
      - REACT_APP_SERVICE_NAME=${REACT_APP_SERVICE_NAME}
      - REACT_APP_DEFAULT_USER_AVATAR=${REACT_APP_DEFAULT_USER_AVATAR}
    ports:
      - '${CLIENT_APP_PORT}:80'
    links:
      - feedbacky-server
    volumes:
      - feedbacky-data:/storage-data
    image: plajer/feedbacky-proxy
    restart: always
  feedbacky-server:
    container_name: feedbacky-server
    ports:
      - '${SERVER_APP_PORT}:8080'
    volumes:
      - feedbacky-data:/storage-data
    env_file:
      - .env
    image: plajer/feedbacky-server
    restart: always

volumes:
  feedbacky-data:
```

1. Create a file called **`.env`** inside the same folder and fill it with contents [located here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Plajer/feedbacky-project/master/.env).

### Configuring Environment Variables (Aka editing .env)

* Inside **`.env`** file edit MySQL related variables, fill **`MYSQL_USERNAME`**, **`MYSQL_PASSWORD`** and **`MYSQL_URL`** with proper data.

{% hint style="danger" %}
Please note that `localhost` won't work in `MYSQL_URL` variable due to nature of Docker (container is considered as a remote machine).

IP of server must be provided and MySQL must be configured to accept non localhost connections.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
To allow non localhost connections modify `bind-address` at `/etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf` to `0.0.0.0,`restart mysql service with `service mysql restart` and create MySQL user with `%` login access eg. `'feedbacky'@'%'`.
{% endhint %}

* Fill `JWT_SECRET` with safely generated text at [https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm](https://www.grc.com/passwords.htm) or any other JWT secret token generator page online. **(Random ASCII characters recommended)**
* If you have any other apps running on ports 8090 or 8095 replace **`CLIENT_APP_PORT`** and **`SERVER_APP_PORT`** with ports that won't collide.
*   Replace `REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` with your server IP and `CLIENT_APP_PORT` Correctly set `REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` should look like:

    * ​✅(Correct) [http://188.222.333.22:8090](../self-hosting/http:/188.222.333.22:8090)
    * ​❌ (Wrong) http://188.222.333.22:8090\*\*/\*\* (Do not use **`/`** at the end)
    * ​❌ (Wrong) 188.222.333.22:8090 (**`http://`** is missing)
    * ​❌ (Wrong) http://188.222.333.22 (No port **`:8090`** provided)

    Check link below if you want to configure Feedbacky to use your own domain name not numeric IP.

[Broken link](broken-reference)
{% endcontent-ref %}

* Configure mail server settings, set `MAIL_SENDER` to no reply email you wish to use. Set `MAIL_SERVICE_TYPE` to one of the following types:

| **Type** | **Provider Name**                | **Limits**                       |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| smtp     | Custom Mail Server               | ------------                     |
| mailgun  | [Mailgun](https://mailgun.com)   | 5k mails/3mo then 0.80$/1k mails |
| sendgrid | [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com) | 40k mails/1mo then 100 mails/day |

> Pricing last updated 06.2020

* Based on your choice fill proper variables (for Mailgun, `MAIL_MAILGUN_API_KEY` and `MAIL_MAILGUN_API_BASE_URL`, for SMTP `MAIL_SMTP_USERNAME`, `MAIL_SMTP_PASSWORD`, `MAIL_SMTP_HOST` and `MAIL_SMTP_PORT`)
* (Optional) Enable image compression to compress all images sent to the service. Set `IMAGE_COMPRESSION_TYPE` to one of the following types:

| **Type** | **Provider Name**                | **Limits**    |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | ------------- |
| cheetaho | [CheetahO](https://cheetaho.com) | 500 images/mo |

> Pricing last updated 06.2020

* Based on your choice fill proper variables (for CheetahO, `IMAGE_COMPRESSION_CHEETAHO_API_KEY`)

### Configuring OAuth apps

Feedbacky is passwordless service and relies on 3rd party services to register and log in. Currently supported OAuth providers are:

* Discord
* Google
* GitHub

**Discord**

To enable Discord login support go to [https://discord.com/developers/applications](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and create new application. Create redirect to your Feedbacky instance (IP from `REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` variable) and include `/auth/discord` at the end.

> ​[Click here](https://cdn.feedbacky.net/static/mp4/discord-oauth-setup.mp4) for short setup video.

Then to allow logging in via Discord set `OAUTH_DISCORD_ENABLED` to `true` and fill `OAUTH_DISCORD_REDIRECT_URI`, `OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET` with credentials you get from OAuth app.

**GitHub**

To enable GitHub login support go to [https://github.com/settings/developers](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create new OAuth app. Set Authorization callback URL to `REACT_APP_SERVER_IP_ADDRESS` and include `/auth/github` at the end.

> ​[Click here](https://cdn.feedbacky.net/static/mp4/github-oauth-setup.mp4) for short setup video.

Then to allow logging in via GitHub set `OAUTH_GITHUB_ENABLED` to `true` and fill `OAUTH_GITHUB_REDIRECT_URI`, `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` with credentials you get from OAuth app.

**Google**

To enable Google login support go to [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com) and create new project. todo

Then to allow logging in via Google set `OAUTH_GOOGLE_ENABLED` to `true` and fill `OAUTH_GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI`, `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` and `OAUTH_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET` with credentials you get from OAuth app.

### Running Feedbacky in the background <a href="#running-feedbacky-in-the-background" id="running-feedbacky-in-the-background"></a>

#### Via screen <a href="#via-screen" id="via-screen"></a>

You can keep track of Feedbacky instance via **`screen`** command. Create new screen with **`screen -S <screen name>`** and go to feedbacky-project folder, to enter screen again after you leave your SSH session just type **`screen -r <screen name>`**.

### Finish - Download sources and start <a href="#compile-sources" id="compile-sources"></a>

Begin the code download process by doing **`docker-compose up`**, downloaded libraries should be less than 200 MB. After everything is downloaded **`feedbacky-server`** instance should start and then you can access your Feedbacky page.
